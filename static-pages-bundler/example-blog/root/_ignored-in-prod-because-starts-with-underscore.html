		<h2>1. The Mindset</h2>
		<p>
			As reverse drafting is for improving existing apps, some
			people think of it as finding problems on their work.
			Therefore, they understandably feel somehow uncomfortable.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, some feel positively when discovering
			improvements for their apps. Here are three reasons why:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Once you've decided to build a good app, finding usability
				issues tells you that you're moving&nbsp;forward.
			</li>
			<li>
				As no one is omniscient, feeling bad about it (as
				long as it's an honest mistake) it's fighting&nbsp;nature.
			</li>
			<li>
				It's easier and faster, you won't need to make up excuses,
				and remember lies.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Of course there's people who are indifferent about how they feel about
			problems in their app. But whether you are neutral or negative, I hope the
			points above help you find some joy when reverse&nbsp;drafting your app.

		<h2>2. When?</h2>
		<p>
			In order to reverse draft, you have to wait until you don't have
			the app highly memorized. Also, make sure your mind is at 100%.
			That is, do it with a fresh mind, after a nap, or waking up.
		</p>

		<h2>3. Pick a part of the app</h2>
		<p>
			Ideally, start with a small part, let's say 5-6 units. By units, I mean
			fields (input or output), instructions, or the options in of a drop down.
		</p>

		<h2>4. Start</h2>
		<p>
			List the UI elements, not as they are, but as text. For example,
			don't make distinctions between Buttons, Checkboxes, or other kind of elements.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stop right when you start feeling that you are making too much
			effort to remember. For example, don't force your visual memory.
